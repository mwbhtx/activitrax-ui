# Activitrax

Activitrax is a full-stack SPA developed to experiment with various aspects of web development such as database management, user security, managing api's and dealing with Oauth2 authorization.

The application is still very much in development and is not currently available for use. I have a few starter applications that I am currently developing and Activitrax is my stretch goal application meant for me to put everything I learn into building an application with services that are desired by myself and others. 

The purpose of Activitrax is to allow users to synchronize their Strava exercise activity with the music streaming platform of their choice. This allows users to go back and review what songs they listened to while they were exercising, and additionally see data related to the music that is playing and what performance impact certain songs may have on their Strava workouts.
